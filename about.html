            <p class="lead">There's more to this guy than meets the eye. He's a very good rat and excellent raven. His analytical gifts lead him 3 steps ahead of confusion. He's the guy you want to follow, and not on Twitter.
            </p>

            <p>His parents gave this middle child a middle initial `E`. His brother and sister got middle names. It took a long time to settle on what he wanted it to stand for – Encourage.</p>

            <p>His attitude is mostly positive because he has a gruesome obsession with sticking around to see what happens. He likes going out on a limb because that's where the fruit is, that's where the most amount of learning happens.</p>

            <p>He uses his Analytical gifts to develop strategies and tactics. Currently he fights for parents 1st, 9th, and 14th amendment rights.</p>
