            <p class="lead">There's more to this guy than meets the eye. He's a very good rat and excellent raven. His analytical gifts lead him 3 steps ahead of confusion. He's the guy you want to follow, and not on Twitter.

            <p>A little bit about me. My parents gave this middle child a middle initial `E`. My brother and sister got middle names. It took a long time to settle on what I want it to stand for – Encourage.</p>

            <p>My attitude is mostly positive because I have a gruesome obsession with sticking around to see what happens. I like going out on a limb because that's where the fruit is, that's where the most amount of learning happens.</p>

            <p>What doesn't kill you does indeed make you stronger. With me it's made an asshole. I have a negative tolerance threshold for petty bullshit; I literally can see it from miles away.</p>

            <p>As an analyst, I develop strategies and tactics. Currently I'm fighting for parents 1st, 9th, and 14th amendments.</p>
