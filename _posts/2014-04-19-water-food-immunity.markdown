They're still in denial about [vaccine injuries][denial] and deaths. I don't know why they don't get it, appreciate it.

Sen. Nicholson says that we don't remember the disease but she isn't even aware of the [National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986][act]. Nor is she and most of our Legislature and doctors aware that there is no [informed consent][consent] and NVIC's founder's excellent essay on the roots of medical ethics.

I had a conversation about childhood deaths of early Colorado settlers with a friend at the Silver Plume cemetery above Georgetown. We concluded they just didn't have enough food to make it through winter.

Of course that's impossible for us to comprehend, but on a practical level, it should be. Once your body hasn't had solid food in 2-4 weeks, one is very weak at the point when one cannot afford it.

Thinking about the 1840-1890 period, it was a very brutal place to have kids. If you didn't have a productive gold or silver claim, you simply were not going to make it through winter. And if you did, that wasn't a guarantee of survival either.

And let's not talk about lack of clean water. Melting snow in winter requires a lot of energy, mostly in summer. Have you ever been so cold that you couldn't function? I have and it's scary. In Summer you better have your strategy in place to get through Colorado winters.

It is weird how I can think of these practical realities, but Sen. Nicholson and Aguilar prefer denial about vaccine injuries. They refuse to even acknowledge that clean water and organic food are the foundations of health.
