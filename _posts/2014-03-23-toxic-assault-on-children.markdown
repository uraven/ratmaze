Our environment is the primary breeding ground for all our health problems.

We're all environmentalists whether we think so or not. Every action we take affects our immediate environment.

Rachel Carson published "Silent Spring" in 1962. Before then it was obvious that using warfare chemicals was creating problems. Rachel died from cancer 2 years later.

Our children are at ever greater health risks from toxins of every kind. 

"I have worked very hard as a biologist and as a citizen to bring data forward. I have submitted petitions, I have written letters, I have testified about the dangers that this kind of storage of explosive gasses creates when you use salt caverns as the receptacle. And having overturned all stones for redress of grievance, I find that that regulatory system itself is unresponsive and deaf to the petitions of citizens and scientists."
