Facts do not matter in politics, only money and election considerations matter.


While that sounds cynical, I've witnessed first hand where a party will dodge every fact with irrelevant issues.

I say, "The CDC doesn't blame the unvaccinated" and they say "We need education and more of it!"

It's an endless treadmill designed to make constituents give up.

If you can't stand the brutal, childish bullying of politics, then you had better develop amnesia. Politicians <em>must</em> do that every day!
