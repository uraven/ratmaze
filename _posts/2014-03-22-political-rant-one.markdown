It's difficult to find an experience anything more infuriating than politics.

Facts don't matter. Political considerations reign. There's only two considerations: getting elected and money. Those two go hand in glove in pockets of lobbyists.

I wish it were a court of law. Most of the premises of controversial bills wouldn't be allowed in a court of law.
