"It is time that ALL men and women forgive and let go of the despicable and oppressive programming of the patriarchal mindset. That includes this insidious idea that women are beneath men as well as the archaic concept that all men are somehow trolls, seeking to dominate.

And it is time that ALL men gratefully accept their Divine Masculinity and thus, step up and unconditionally support, unquestionably nurture and unfailingly uphold the Divine Feminine energies of this world. For this is the role of ALL men who are born to be Kings.

Equally so, it's time that ALL women stop commiserating about past grievances and passing this torch through each generation that you somehow have an ax-to-grind with men. ALL women need to step out of the past and gracefully glide into the present moment by owning your own Divinity. A Queen owns Her space with Love...not shame. She doesn't flaunt her Powers anymore than She shrinks from the powerful Light that shines upon Her.

That said, if women want their King to see them and accept them it is necessary that women stop losing themselves in this harmful fantasy that a man will show up and be their King. The only way a man will see His Queen is when the Queen sees Her-Self worthy of being the Divine Queen that She was born to be.

This goes back to a key point of undoing centuries of dysfunctional and debilitating teachings of the patriarchal mindset. When women stop trying to control a man, men will realize who really is in control. A key to grasping this is for both women and men to fully recognize that Life is born in the womb of the Divine Feminine, not in the loins of a man. This should tell us who really is in control .

A man's role is to uphold and co-facilitate a sacred space for his Queen to rule through Love and not anger and guilt. Until both women and men understand this men and women of this generation and the next will keep following the false teachings of past generations, which is pure insanity."

I've been saying for years the world would be a much better place if women ran it. In order for women to run it, men must stop embracing violence and destruction as their metric.
