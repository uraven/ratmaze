<p>Rep. Pabon and the Dems who voted Yes on HB 1288 gave away the game plan for Colorado Vaccine Exemptions.</p>

<p>First clue was how testimony against this bill was ignored. I personally testified that the entire bill was based on the lack of informed consent. I stated <em>"It relies on uninformed consent to manufacture a false solution to a public health issue. It lays blame where blame is unwarranted.</p>

<p>"No amount of arguing in favor of this bill will undo the damage done. No argument against this bill will ever change the supporterâ€™s beliefs.</p>

<p>"Legislators voting this bill out of committee do so based solely on personal belief that the consequences arising out of the lack of informed consent will solve public health problems.</p>

<p>"Public policy should be based on facts, and exemptions should be based on personal beliefs."</p></em>

<p>Every fact that undermined the bill was dodged with another illogical line of reasoning that also was not supported by facts. Round and round it spun nonsensically, illogically.</p>

<p>At the second hearing one rep could be heard saying that if a child died, too bad. I'm surprised that Rep. Pabon didn't shout "Kill 'em! Maim 'em! We don't care! Children's Hospital's right over there!"</p>

<p>And that wouldn't have surprised me because nothing supporters say is backed up by facts. It reminded me of <strong>Bowman V. Monsanto, Supreme Court 2013</strong> last summer. Monsanto's lawyer admitted that GMO crops do not increase yields. That's just a marketing ploy.</p>

<p>And that's all that "Dan and the Dems" have: marketing. When you ignore the CDC, CDPHE, FDA, and HHS facts, and ignore the legal realm that allows Danny to spout off any kind of nonsense he wants, it raises questions about the ultimate goal of HB 1288.</p>

<p>Since no bill has or ever will stop an outbreak; since HB 1288 explicitly blames the unvaccinated for disease spread; since the PBE is explicitly blamed for the unvaccinated; since the Dems collectively ignore every single data that contradicts the bill's false premises, the goal is to remove Personal, Religious, and Medical Exemptions.</p>

<p>I'll be very happy if I'm wrong, but I don't think I am because Danny and the Dems staunchly refuse to acknowledge or consider ANY facts whatsoever.</p>

<p>They counter this argument with "no your PBE is not being removed". Their reassurances are actually the opposite. They've compromised public health for the sake of money.</p>

<p><em>"Kill 'em! Maim 'em! We don't care! Children's Hospital's right over there!"</em></p>
